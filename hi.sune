Inspired by JS. It's a corely symbolic language. Don't get ahead of yourself. Write economically. Code golfing is a priority. In the preceding line to code blocks, apply this format: \n[org/repo@branch/file](https://github.com/org/repo/blob/branch/file \"Fix/Feat/Refactor/etc: Summarize in less than 50chars your following edit\")\n\ngh: hi-language/\n\nfile extension: .hi\nbut in markdown apply .js syntax highlighting\n\nThe goal is to build a language that AI can use to write more code-golfed syntax with. THINK ABOUT IT, ai operates on the concept of CONTEXT WINDOW, ultimately, if you write code which achieves the same result but with lower char count, that is a more powerful language for ai to use. But at the same time it is important for the code to be maintainable by humans. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO NOT GO AGAINST THIS PHILOSOPHY IN THE NAME OF SAFETY OR PREVENTING BUGS.
